# --- Advent of code 2022! ---
These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
***
## Format
The days are split up into separate folders, where each folder contains:
| Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| __{day}.py__ | A file with the solutions to the problems, written in Python 3.10.8. |
| __sample__ | A file with that day's sample input. This is used for some simple tests. |
| __puzzle-input__ | A file with my unique puzzle input that day. |

## Download and usage
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:nilsmo1/aoc2022.git
$ cd aoc2022/
```
To use this repo as I intended, you should only need `curl` and some version of `python3`. If you don't want to use the __NEWDAY.sh__, you only need `python3`.

## Code template
I've included a template which I use for my code to have a consistent structure of each day's solution.

## Script for starting a new day 
The file **NEWDAY.sh** is a template script which takes in the number of a day and creates a folder for that day. It creates the needed files and uses `curl` to download that day's puzzle input into the __puzzle-input__ file. 
To use this script you need to replace the "__?__" in:
```sh
curl -o puzzle-input -b 'session=?' https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/$1/input
```
With the value of your own session cookie.
This script only needs to run once per day, and therefore it should not cause any traffic issues.



## (Side note)
This is a (not so) fun little thing I just found out:
```
>>> from collections import defaultdict
>>> c = defaultdict(list)
>>> c[1].append(1)
>>> c[1].append(2)
>>> def s(k):
...     k[1].append(2)
... 
>>> s(c)
>>> c
defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {1: [1, 2, 2]})
>>> cc = {i: v for i, v in c.items()}
>>> cc
{1: [1, 2, 2]}
>>> s(c)
>>> c
defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {1: [1, 2, 2, 2]})
>>> cc
{1: [1, 2, 2, 2]}
```
